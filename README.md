## Basis and Problem Statement
In This section, we will explore the basic information about cannabis leagalization in Ontario, then learn about the problem which Kuber sets to solve.

#### Legalization Info
Marijuana is set to be legalized on October 17th, 2018. When cannabis is legalized on October 17, 2018, Ontario’s Government for the People will be ready with rules that keep cannabis out of the hands of children and youth,
 and keep our roads safe. You will need to be 19 and older to buy, use, possess and grow recreational cannabis. This is the same as the minimum age for the sale of tobacco and alcohol in Ontario.
You will only be able to use recreational cannabis in:

a private residence, including the outdoor space of a home (for example, a porch or back yard)
your unit or on your balcony, if you live in a multi-unit building like an apartment or condo, but that depends on your building’s rules or your lease agreement
You will not be allowed to have any cannabis in your system (as detected by a federally approved oral fluid screening device) if you are driving a motor vehicle and:
```
you are 21 or under
have a G1, G2, M1 or M2 licence
the vehicle you are driving requires an A-F driver’s licence or Commercial Vehicle Operator’s Registration (CVOR)
you are driving a road-building machine
```
#### Buying Cannabis
When it’s legal, people 19 and over will be able to purchase cannabis online through the Ontario Cannabis Store. Online orders will be delivered safely and securely. Consumers will be required to verify their age to accept delivery and no packages will be left unattended at the door.

You will be able to purchase up to 30 grams (about one ounce) of dried recreational cannabis at one time for personal use.

As of October 17, 2018, the Ontario Cannabis Store website will be the only legal option for purchasing recreational cannabis. It will follow strict rules set by the federal government.
```
The government will also introduce legislation that, if passed, would open up a tightly regulated private retail model for cannabis that would launch by April 1, 2019.  Private stores would be regulated, with the protection of youth and children as a top priority, and will help the province combat the illegal market.
```

#### Medical Cannabis
Medical cannabis is subject to different rules than recreational cannabis. The production and sale of medical cannabis is regulated exclusively by the federal government.

If a health care professional has already authorized you to use cannabis for medical reasons, your access will not change when recreational cannabis is legal.

The only way to purchase medical cannabis is from:

a federally licensed producer online
by written order
over the phone and delivered by secure mail
You can also receive a licence from Health Canada to grow medical cannabis on your own, or designate someone else to grow it on your behalf.

#### Growing Cannabis
You will be able to grow up to four plants per residence (not per person). Starting October 17, 2018, you will be able to purchase legal seeds from the Ontario Cannabis Store online.

Kuber is an app platform set to allow dispensaries to operate securely online prior to and after the privatization of cannabis

The app works by employing a driver from a given dispensary, and having him/her monitor an alert system.

A customer may select the dispensary from the 'map' section of our app. He will then be prompted to select

* Strain  and amount of cannabis
* Smoking / Vaping accessories
* Pre-rolled joints and edibles (In the future when we operate from privatized head shops)


Another main part of the app comes in the form of the 'me' section. Here, we will require a user to provide:

* A piece of Photo ID
* A clear picture of him/her self taken with front camera
* Delivery details (Address, best times, notes, etc...)

Additional settings such as

* Strain Preferences
* Dispensary Preferences
* MYKU Interface (Subscription weed service)

Can also be set after the more basic settings have been supplied.
